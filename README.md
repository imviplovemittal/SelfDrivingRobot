# SelfDrivingRobot Proximity-Sensor Robot
This repository contains the code and instructions for training a robot with 6 proximity sensors to navigate an environment and reach a goal without hitting any walls or objects. The robot's movement is controlled by a neural network, which achieves an accuracy of over 98%. This project includes a video that demonstrates the robot's performance after training.

Usage
To train the robot, run the following command:

```python train_model.py```

To test the robot's performance, run:

```python goal_seeking.py```

## Neural Network Architecture
The robot is controlled by an action-conditioned feedforward neural network. The network has the following architecture:

- Input layer: 6 neurons (one for each proximity sensor)
- Hidden layer 1: 12 neurons
- Hidden layer 2: 96 neurons
- Hidden layer 3: 192 neurons
- Output layer: 1 neuron (for the action)

The ReLU activation function is used between each layer.

The code snippet below shows the network's implementation:

```
def __init__(self, input_size=6, output_size=1):
    super(Action_Conditioned_FF, self).__init__()
    self.layer_1 = nn.Linear(input_size, 12)
    self.layer_2 = nn.Linear(12, 96)
    self.layer_3 = nn.Linear(96, 192)
    self.layer_out = nn.Linear(192, output_size)
    self.relu = nn.ReLU()

def forward(self, input):
    hidden = self.relu(self.layer_1(input))
    hidden = self.relu(self.layer_2(hidden))
    hidden = self.relu(self.layer_3(hidden))
    output = self.layer_out(hidden)
    return output
    
```

## Training Data Generation
Training data is generated by moving the robot without training for a long time. This process provides a diverse set of situations and allows the robot to learn how to navigate different environments.
